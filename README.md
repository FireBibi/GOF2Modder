# GOF2Modder

This app requires TrollStore. TrollStore is a jailed app that can install permanently apps with special privileges using an exploit in AMFI/CoreTrust. The only supported iOS/iPadOS versions are **iOS 14.0 to iOS 15.4.1**. Some betas are also supported : **iOS 15.5b1-4** and **iOS 15.6b1.5**. A new CoreTrust exploit has been discovered, there is no PoC for now, once one drop, TrollStore will perhaps be updated to support up to iOS 17.0 (excluding iOS 16.7+). 
If you are on iOS 16.7 and want to be able to use the app [DelayOTA](https://dhinakg.github.io/delayed-otas.html), download the profile for **iOS 17.0** and update to **iOS 17.0**.


GOF2Modder is a tool that allows you to mod Galaxy On Fire 2 HD.
Modding is for now only changing items/ships/galaxies/stations stats.

## Installing

1. First follow [TrollStore's guide](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).
2. Then download the ipa from the release tab (or the action tab if you want latest release).
3. Open the ipa in TrollStore and click install.
4. Enjoy !

### Features planned
- Retexturing
- Profiles
- Texture exporting (and converting)
- Other bin modding
- A text field which would make editing more precise
- Save editing

## Issues

There are probably lots of issues inside of the app currently. You can report them in the "Issues" tab on GitHub. You can also contact me on discord @rootfs.
